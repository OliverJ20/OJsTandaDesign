# OJsTandaDesign

SO i feel it still needs some work design wise with making things more softer but couple points / ideas of features to add to the design since its mainly the same as the current tanda roster design & I'm still not super sure how I feel about that, if its alright to keep it similiar and only add a few features I feel are benecfical or not, but I have saught out multiple managers I know who make rosters and showed them my designs and plans and most seemed to like it.

There is also some basic javascript I wish to add to enhance some base functionality, to have certain elements such as display buttons working and possible elements within the setting field

so the settings button will allow the user to edit and customize the roster page such as
              1. The ability to change various colours of certain items or turn them off
              2. The ability to set a minimum or maximum staff number which will be highlighted if it is over or below the desired setting
              3. The ability to set a minimum or maximum cost for the roster and highlighting it accordingly

The view buttons at the bottom, standard, current, future and previous work as detailed 
    Standard - displays top ten rosters from latest going down
    Current - displays all rosters for the current month only
    Future - Displays all rosters for future months 
    Previous - Displays all rosters from the previous month plus
    
at the top of the page are two select lists, this will allow the user to select a particular month, with the options only being avaliable future months. When that is selected the user can automatically generate roster rows for that month so they can simple create the roster from the table. 

The add button allows the user to add a single new row of the next roster date to the table. 

Other items i am considering adding is more fine specifics for rosters, like the ability to pick between a day/night roster or a open and close roster type.
